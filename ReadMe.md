# DiscordLM
training a little transformer language model on discord chat logs. mainly just to learn how to fully set up a custom pytorch pipeline. implementing transformer based on "Attention Is All You Need" paper and Karpathy's NanoGPT.

Steps of the process
1. clean up data
2. design model/pipeline <----- here currently
3. train/eval

Data hidden for obvious privacy reasons. Will keep process documented.

Things to try later:
- data without line breaks
